# Physical-Tracking-System
GVSU Computer Science Capstone Project - A physical tracking system used to provide investment casting traceability through mold-level operations for a manufacturing company.

## Project Title: 
Investment casting traceability through mold-level operations

## Project Description: 
The student team will be responsible to develop and implement a physical tracking system for investment castings at a mold-level. This system will interface with piece-level operations before and after mold-level functions. The system will scan, track and assist with inventory queuing at dewax operations providing visual status of next-up molds. 

The software will be written in C# and will need to communicate to an Oracle 12c database, potentially a Microsoft SQL database and a few select models of Allen Bradley PLCs. All software tools and required connectivity will be provided. 
The final deliverable is an integrated system to track molds in areas of which are difficult to maintain paperwork. The output data will feed our analytics environment providing data integrity and closing a traceability gap.
